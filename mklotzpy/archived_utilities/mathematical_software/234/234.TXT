Note to the mathematically unsophisticated:

If you're unfamiliar with terms like quadratic, cubic, quartic equations or
real, imaginary, complex numbers this program may be way over your head.  I
don't have the time to provide a comprehensive discussion of these aspects of
mathematics.  Refer to your local mathematical guru or that neglected algebra
textbook.

	While working a geometry problem recently, I encountered a quartic
equation.  I honestly believe that, in 30+ years of doing applied mathematics,
this is the first time I've ever encountered a quartic in a useful application.
The equation was:

	x^4 - 12*x^3 -328*x^2 + 4800*x - 14400 = 0

	The CRC handbook contains a closed form solution for quartics but,
unless you implement it on a computer, the likelihood of weaving through its
intricacies without an error is pretty low.  So I decided to program it.  The
(quartic) solution requires one to solve a cubic as part of the algorithm.  So
I threw in the analytic solution for a cubic as well.  And, as long as I was
about it, completeness demanded I add the relatively trivial solution for a
quadratic.

	First express your equation in the appropriate canonical form:

	ax^2 + bx + c = 0			(quadratic)
	ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0		(cubic)
	ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0		(quartic)

	We'll assume that whatever equation you have arose from a real world
problem (as opposed to a mathematical or electrical problem) and so all the
coefficients (a,...,e) are real numbers.  (If that's not true, you're on your
own.)  When the program runs, specify the order (2,3,4) of your equation and
then proceed to enter the coefficients as they're requested.  The program will
then print out the solutions as complex numbers.  For real world problems,
you'll probably only be interested in the real solutions.  If you don't get at
least one real solution, check your equation closely - you've probably got one
or more of the coefficients wrong.  If you get multiple real solutions, there
will probably be other constraints in the problem which allow you to pick the
one that "makes sense" in the context of the problem.

Some warnings:

	Like so many programs, it's impossible to exhaustively check the
operation of this one.  Should you locate an error in what I've done, be sure
to contact me (mklotz@alum.mit.edu) with a complete description of the problem.

	While the quartic solution worked for my problem as well as several
test problems I fed it, there is still a term in the solution that could be
problematical.  In the solution, I've treated this quantity (R) as a real
despite the fact that it is the result of a square root and therefore *could
possibly* be a complex number.  I haven't the patience to attempt a proof that
R is always real for real world problems - in fact, that may not be provable.
If R does turn out to be complex, the program will refuse to generate a
solution for the quartic.  Contact me if this happens.
