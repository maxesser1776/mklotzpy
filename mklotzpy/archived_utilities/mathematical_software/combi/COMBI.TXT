Calculating the number of combinations of N things taken M at a time is
straightforward - many scientific calculators have a key to perform this
computation.  For reference, the relevant equation is:

		C(N,M) = N!/[M! * (N-M)!]

where the notation x! denotes x factorial (1*2*...x).

However, I find that most often what I really need is an *enumeration* of all
the combinations - a list of the type:

6 things taken 4 at a time
Number of combinations = 15
1: ABCE
2: ABCF
3: ACEF
4: ACDE
5: ACDF
6: ADEF
7: CDEF
8: BCEF
9: BCDE
10: BCDF
11: BDEF
12: ABEF
13: ABDE
14: ABDF
15: ABCD

so that I can try all the different combinations in something I'm doing (e.g.,
exhaustive testing of program option combinations or optimal fitting of not
quite identical parts).

As written, the program will accept values of N and M up to 52 (the number of
letters in the combined upper/lower case alphabets).  If you have need of
greater than that number, let me know - the program is not memory-bound and can
be expanded.

Output is written to a file that can be printed and carried to the shop.
