This is a handy tool to calculate various types of curve fits to a set of
bivarate data.  Enter data pairs into the data file in the form:

	x,y

where:

	x = independent variable
	y = dependent variable

and then run the program.  You may choose from four types of fits.

polynomial  fit: Y = A0 + A1*X + A2*X^2 + A3*X^3 + ...
logarithmic fit: Y = A + B * ln(X)
exponential fit: Y = A * exp (B * X)
power       fit: Y = A * X^B

The program will then provide the best least squares estimate of the
parameters (A,B) needed to fit the curve.  A summary showing the error of the
fit at each value of x is printed as is the correlation coefficient, a measure
of how good the fit is.

Use care.  The program does not check for obvious idiocies, e.g., logarithmic
fits to data that is <= zero will cause crashes.
