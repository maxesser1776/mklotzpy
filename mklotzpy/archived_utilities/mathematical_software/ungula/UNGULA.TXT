If you put a small amount of water in a cylindrical glass and then tilt the
glass so the water doesn't completely cover the bottom of the glass, the water
takes on a shape that is called an ungula in mathematics.  [This term derives
from the fact that the shape resembles the hoof of a cow, which is 'ungula' in
Latin.  In biology, the order Ungulata includes the hoofed animals - horses,
cattle, pigs, elephants, etc..]

The program calculates the volume of this shape.  Inputs are:

The diameter of the cylinder (diameter of the glass in the example)

The height of the ungula (how far up the side of the glass does the water
extend - measured along the side of the glass from the bottom)

The sagitta of the ungula.  This is the distance from the wall of the cylinder
to the straight line formed by the fluid across the bottom, measured along a
diameter from the wetted side of the glass.

The formula implemented in the program is valid for sagittas greater than zero
and less than or equal to the diameter of the cylinder (glass).  In the case
where the sagitta equals the diameter of the cylinder, the somewhat complex
formula reduces to a simple result - volume = (2/3)*h*r*r where h is the height
mentioned above and r is the radius of the cylinder.

As with many of my programs, no units are specified for the input measurements.
Use any consistent units for the input dimensions and the resulting volume will
be expressed in the cube of the dimensions used, e.g., for dimensions expressed
in inches, the volume will be in cubic inches.
