Imagine a cone being sliced by a plane parallel to the axis of the cone.  If
the slicing is done along a line offset from the axis, the cone will be divided
into two pieces.  The smaller of these two pieces is referred to as a conical
wedge.  Calculating the volume of this wedge involves an ugly triple integral
which yields a complex formula.  This program implements that formula in a
user-friendly format.

The program asks for the "sagitta" of the wedge.  This is the distance from the
edge (i.e., circumference) of the cone base to the plane which slices the cone,
measured along a diameter of the cone base.
