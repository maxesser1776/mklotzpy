This program calculates properties of *regular* polygons - polygons with equal
length sides.  After entering the number of sides, you have your option of
specifying the "size" of the polygon in one of four ways.

	Length of a side.

	Distance across the flats if number of sides even.

	Distance from one flat to the opposite vertex if number of sides odd.

	Diameter of circumscribed circle.  That is the circle that passes
through each vertex.

	Diameter of inscribed circle.  That is the circle that lies inside the
polygon and is tangent to each of the edges.

	Skip over whichever you *don't* know by pressing the enter key. 
However, you must specify at least one of the above to obtain a solution.
Units don't matter.  All output will be implicitly in the units assumed by you
when you answer one of the three questions.

	Once one of these three is specified the program will compute and
display all relevant information for the polygon.
