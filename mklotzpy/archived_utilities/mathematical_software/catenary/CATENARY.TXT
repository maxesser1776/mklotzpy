A catenary (name derived from the Latin word for chain) is the shape assumed by an flexible, non-extensible chain or cable hung from two points under the influence of gravity.

This program allows one to compute the droop at the middle of the chain and the total length of the chain as a function of the support separation, the chain tension and the chain weight per unit length.
