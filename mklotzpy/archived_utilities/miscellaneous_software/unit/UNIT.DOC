The Systeme International [S I]

Le Systeme international d'Unites officially came into being in October 1960
and has been adopted by nearly all countries, though the amount of actual usage
varies considerably.

It is based upon 7 principal units, 1 in each of 7 different categories -

                        Category             Name            Abbreviation

                        Length                  metre                   m
                        Mass                    kilogram                kg
                        Time                    second                  s
                        Electric current        ampere                  A
                        Temperature             kelvin                  K
                        Amount of substance     mole                    mol
                        Luminous intensity      candela                 cd

Definitions of these basic units are given.

Each of these units may take a prefix.

From these basic units many other units are derived and named.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions of the Seven Basic S I Units

  metre [m]
    The metre is the basic unit of length. It is the distance light
    travels, in a vacuum, in 1/299792458th of a second.

  kilogram [kg]
    The kilogram is the basic unit of mass. It is the mass of an
    international prototype in the form of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept
    at Sevres in France. It is now the only basic unit still defined in
    terms of a material object, and also the only one with a prefix[kilo]
    already in place.

  second [s]
    The second is the basic unit of time. It is the length of time taken
    for 9192631770 periods of vibration of the caesium-133 atom to occur.

  ampere [A]
    The ampere is the basic unit of electric current. It is that current
    which produces a specified force between two parallel wires which are 1
    metre apart in a vacuum.It is named after the French physicist Andre
    Ampere (1775-1836).

  kelvin [K]
    The kelvin is the basic unit of temperature. It is 1/273.16th of the
    thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. It is named
    after the Scottish mathematician and physicist William Thomson 1st Lord
    Kelvin (1824-1907).

  mole [mol]
    The mole is the basic unit of substance. It is the amount of substance
    that contains as many elementary units as there are atoms in 0.012 kg
    of carbon-12.

  candela [cd]
    The candela is the basic unit of luminous intensity. It is the
    intensity of a source of light of a specified frequency, which gives a
    specified amount of power in a given direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Derived Units of the S I

From the 7 basic units of the SI many other units are derived for a variety of
purposes. Only some of them are explained here. The units printed in bold are
either basic units or else, in some cases, are themselves derived.

  farad [F]
    The farad is the SI unit of the capacitance of an electrical system,
    that is, its capacity to store electricity. It is a rather large unit
    as defined and is more often used as a microfarad. It is named after
    the English chemist and physicist Michael Faraday (1791-1867).

  hertz [Hz]
    The hertz is the SI unit of the frequency of a periodic phenomenon. One
    hertz indicates that 1 cycle of the phenomenon occurs every second. For
    most work much higher frequencies are needed such as the kiloherz [kHz]
    and megaherz [MHz]. It is named after the German physicist Heinrich
    Rudolph Herz (1857-94).

  joule [J]
    The joule is the SI unit of work or energy. One joule is the amount of
    work done when an applied force of 1 newton moves through a distance of
    1 metre in the direction of the force.It is named after the English
    physicist James Prescott Joule (1818-89).

  newton [N]
    The newton is the SI unit of force. One newton is the force required to
    give a mass of 1 kilogram an acceleration of 1 metre per second per
    second. It is named after the English mathematician and physicist Sir
    Isaac Newton (1642-1727).

  ohm [*]
    The ohm is the SI unit of resistance of an electrical conductor. Its
    symbol, shown here as [*] is the Greek letter known as 'omega'. It is
    named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1789-1854).

  pascal [Pa]
    The pascal is the SI unit of pressure. One pascal is the pressure
    generated by a force of 1 newton acting on an area of 1 square metre.
    It is a rather small unit as defined and is more often used as a
    kilopascal [kPa]. It is named after the French mathematician, physicist
    and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623-62).

  volt [V]
    The volt is the SI unit of electric potential. One volt is the
    difference of potential between two points of an electical conductor
    when a current of 1 ampere flowing between those points dissipates a
    power of 1 watt. It is named after the Italian physicist Count
    Alessandro Giuseppe Anastasio Volta (1745-1827).

  watt [W]
    The watt is used to measure power or the rate of doing work. One watt
    is a power of 1 joule per second. It is named after the Scottish
    engineer James Watt (1736-1819).

Note that prefixes may be used in conjunction with any of the above units.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Prefixes of the S I

The S I allows the sizes of units to be made bigger or smaller by the use of
appropriate prefixes. For example, the electrical unit of a watt is not a big
unit even in terms of ordinary household use, so it is generally used in terms
of 1000 watts at a time. The prefix for 1000 is kilo so we use kilowatts[kW] as
our unit of measurement. For makers of electricity, or bigger users such as
industry, it is common to use megawatts[MW] or even gigawatts[GW]. The full
range of prefixes with their [symbols or abbreviations] and their multiplying
factors which are also given in other forms is

        yotta [Y] 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000     = 10^24
        zetta [Z] 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000         = 10^21
        exa   [E] 1 000 000 000 000 000 000             = 10^18
        peta  [P] 1 000 000 000 000 000                 = 10^15
        tera  [T] 1 000 000 000 000                     = 10^12
        giga  [G] 1 000 000 000                    (a thousand millions = a billion)
        mega  [M] 1 000 000                        (a million)
        kilo  [k] 1 000                            (a thousand)
        hecto [h] 100
        deca  [da]10
                  1
        deci  [d] 0.1
        centi [c] 0.01
        milli [m] 0.001                            (a thousandth)
        micro [u] 0.000 001                          (a millionth)
        nano  [n] 0.000 000 001                    (a thousand millionth)
        pico  [p] 0.000 000 000 001                     = 10^-12
        femto [f] 0.000 000 000 000 001                 = 10^-15
        atto  [a] 0.000 000 000 000 000 001             = 10^-18
        zepto [z] 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 001         = 10^-21
        yocto [y] 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 000 001     = 10^-24
[u] the symbol used for micro is the Greek letter known as 'mu'
Nearly all of the S I prefixes are multiples or sub-multiples of 1000. However,
these are inconvenient for many purposes and so hecto, deca, deci, and centi
are also used.
deca also appears as deka [da] or [dk] in the USA and Contintental Europe. So
much for standards!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conventions of Usage in the S I

There are various rules laid down for the use of the SI and its units as well
as some observations to be made that will help in its correct use.

    Any unit may take only ONE prefix. For example 'millimillimetre' is
    incorrect and should be written as 'micrometre'.
    Most prefixes which make a unit bigger are written in capital letters
    (M G T etc.), but when they make a unit smaller then lower case (m n p
    etc.) is used. Exceptions to this are the kilo [k] to avoid any
    possible confusion with kelvin [K]; hecto [h]; and deca [da] or [dk]
    A unit which is named after a person is written all in lower case
    (newton, volt, pascal etc.) when named in full, but starting with a
    capital letter (N V Pa etc.) when abbreviated. An exception to this
    rule is the litre which, if written as a lower case 'l' could be
    mistaken for a '1' (one) and so a capital 'L' is allowed as an
    alternative. It is intended that a single letter will be decided upon
    some time in the future when it becomes clear which letter is being
    favoured most in use.
    Units written in abbreviated form are NEVER pluralised. So 'm' could
    always be either 'metre' or 'metres'. 'ms' could represent 'metre
    second' (whatever that is) or, more correctly, 'millisecond'.
    An abbreviation (such as J N g Pa etc.) is NEVER followed by a
    full-stop unless it is the end of a sentence.
    To make numbers easier to read they may be divided into groups of 3
    separated by spaces (or half-spaces) but NOT commas.
    The SI preferred way of showing a decimal fraction is to use a comma
    (123,456) to separate the whole number from its fractional part. The
    practice of using a point, as is common in English-speaking countries,
    is acceptable providing only that the point is placed ON the line of
    the bottom edge of the numbers (123.456).
    It will be noted that many units are eponymous, that is they are named
    after persons. This is always someone who was prominent in the early
    work done within the field in which the unit is used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Brief History of Measurement

One of the earliest types of measurement concerned that of length. These
measurements were usually based on parts of the body. A well documented example
(the first) is the Egyptian cubit which was derived from the length of the arm
from the elbow to the outstretched finger tips. By 2500 BC this had been
standardised in a royal master cubit made of black marble (about 52 cm). This
cubit was divided into 28 digits (roughly a finger width) which could be
further divided into fractional parts, the smallest of these being only just
over a millimetre.

In England units of measurement were not properly standardised until the 13th
century, though variations (and abuses) continued until long after that. For
example, there were three different gallons (ale, wine and corn) up until 1824
when the gallon was standardised.

In the U S A the system of weights and measured first adopted was that of the
English, though a few differences came in when decisions were made at the time
of standardisation in 1836. For instance, the wine-gallon of 231 cubic inches
was used instead of the English one (as defined in 1824) of about 277 cubic
inches. The U S A also took as their standard of dry measure the old Winchester
bushel of 2150.42 cubic inches, which gave a dry gallon of nearly 269 cubic
inches.

Even as late as the middle of the 20th century there were some differences in
UK and US measures which were nominally the same. The UK inch measured 2.53998
cm while the US inch was 2.540005 cm. Both were standardised at 2.54 cm in July
1959, though the U S continued to use 'their' value for several years in land
surveying work - this too is slowly being metricated.

In France the metric system officially started in June 1799 with the declared
intent of being 'For all people, for all time'. The unit of length was the
metre which was defined as being one ten-millionth part of a quarter of the
earth's circumference. The production of this standard required a very careful
survey to be done which took several years. However, as more accurate
instruments became available so the 'exactness' of the standard was called into
question. Later efforts were directed at finding some absolute standard based
on an observable physical phenomenon. Over two centuries this developed into
the S I. So maybe their original slogan was more correct than anyone could have
foreseen then.

Metric System of Measurements

                Length                                         Area
          10 millimetres = 1 centimetre                 100 sq. mm     = 1 sq. cm
          10 centimetres = 1 decimeter               10 000 sq. cm     = 1 sq. metre
          10 decimetres  = 1 metre                      100 sq. metres = 1 are
          10 metres      = 1 decametre                  100 ares       = 1 hectare
          10 decametres  = 1 hectometre              10 000 sq. metres = 1 hectare
          10 hectometres = 1 kilometre                  100 hectares   = 1 sq. kilometre
        1000 metres      = 1 kilometre            1 000 000 sq. metres = 1 sq. kilometre

                Volume                                           Capacity
        1000 cu. mm = 1 cu. cm                           10 millilitres = 1 centilitre
        1000 cu. cm = 1 cu. decimetre                    10 centilitree = 1 decilitre
        1000 cu. dm = 1 cu. metre                        10 decilitres  = 1 litre
   1 million cu. cm = 1 cu. metre                      1000 litres      = 1 cu. metre

                                        Mass
                                1000 grams     = 1 kilogram
                                1000 kilograms = 1 tonne
The distinction between 'Volume' and 'Capacity' is artificial and kept here
only for historic reasons.
A millitre is a cubic centimetre and a cubic decimetre is a litre. But see
under 'Volume' for problems with the litre.

The U K (Imperial) System of Measurements

                 Length                                      Area
          12 inches   = 1 foot                   144 sq. inches = 1 square foot
           3 feet     = 1 yard                     9 sq. feet   = 1 square yard
          22 yards    = 1 chain                 4840 sq. yards  = 1 acre
          10 chains   = 1 furlong                640 acres      = 1 square mile
           8 furlongs = 1 mile
        5280 feet     = 1 mile
        1760 yards    = 1 mile                          Capacity
                                                20 fluid ounces = 1 pint
                Volume                            4 gills        = 1 pint
        1728 cu. inches = 1 cubic foot           2 pints        = 1 quart
          27 cu. feet   = 1 cubic yard           4 quarts       = 1 gallon (8 pints)

                Mass (Avoirdupois)
        437.5 grains = 1 ounce                          Troy Weights
         16 ounces   = 1 pound (7000 grains)    24 grains        = 1 pennyweight
         14 pounds   = 1 stone                  20 pennyweights  = 1 ounce (480 grains)
          8 stones   = 1 hundredweight [cwt]    12 ounces        = 1 pound (5760 grains)
         20 cwt      = 1 ton (2240 pounds)

           Apothecaries' Measures                  Apothecaries' Weights
         20 minims      = 1 fl.scruple          20 grains   = 1 scruple
          3 fl.scruples = 1 fl.drachm            3 scruples = 1 drachm
          8 fl.drachms  = 1 fl.ounce             8 drachms  = 1 ounce (480 grains)
         20 fl.ounces   = 1 pint                12 ounces   = 1 pound (5760 grains)
The old Imperial (now UK) system was originally defined by three standard
measures - the yard, the pound and the gallon which were held in London. They
are now defined by reference to the S I measures of the metre, the kilogram and
the litre. These equivalent measures are exact.

1 yard = 0.9144 metres - same as US
1 pound = 0.453 592 37 kilograms - same as US
1 gallon = 4.546 09 litres
Note particularly that the UK gallon is a different size to the US gallon so
that NO liquid measures of the same name are the same size in the UK and US
systems.
Also that the ton(UK) is 2240 pounds while a ton(US) is 2000 pounds. These are
also referred to as a long ton and short ton respectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Metrication in the U K

There have been three major Weights and Measures Acts in recent times (1963,
1976 and 1985) all gradually abolishing various units, as well re-defining the
standards. All the Apothecaries' measures are gone, and of the Troy measures,
only the ounce remains. Currently legislation has decreed that -

From the 1st October 1995, for economic, public health, public safety and
administrative purposes, only metric units are allowed EXCEPT that -
  * pounds and ounces for weighing of goods sold from bulk
  * pints and fluid ounces for beer, cider, waters, lemonades and fruit juices
    in RETURNABLE containers
  * therms for gas supply
  * fathoms for marine navigation

may be used until 31st December 1999.

The following may continue to be used WITHOUT time limit -
  * miles, yards, feet and inches for road traffic signs and related
    measurements of speed and distance
  * pints for dispensing draught beer and cider, and for milk in RETURNABLE
    containers
  * acres for land registration purposes
  * troy ounces for transactions in precious metals.

Sports are exempt from all of this, but most of them have (voluntarily) changed
their relevant regulations into statements of equivalent metric measures.

That is how the legislation is framed. In common usage the 'old' units are
still very apparent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The U S System of Measurements

Most of the US system of measurements is the same as that for the UK. The
biggest differences to be noted are in Capacity which has both liquid and dry
measures as well as being based on a different standard - the US liquid gallon
is smaller than the UK gallon. There is also a measurement known at the US
survey foot. It is gradually being phased out as the maps and land plans are
re-drawn under metrication. (The changeover is being made by putting 39.37 US
survey feet = 12 metres)

As with the UK system these measures were originally defined by physical
standard measures - the yard, the pound, the gallon and the bushel.They are now
all defined by reference to the S I measures of the metre, the kilogram and the
litre. These equivalent measures are exact.

1 yard = 0.9144 metres - same as UK
1 pound = 0.453 592 37 kilograms - same as UK
1 gallon (liquid) = 3.785 411 784 litres
1 bushel = 35.239 070 166 88 litres
Note particularly that the US gallon is a different size to the UK gallon so
that NO liquid measures of the same name are the same size in the US and UK
systems.
Also that the ton(US) is 2000 pounds while a ton(UK) is 2240 pounds. These are
also referred to as a short ton and long ton respectively.
Note than in matters concerned with land measurements, for the most accurate
work, it is necessary to establish whether the US survey measures are being
used or not.

Volume or Capacity

The S I unit of volume is the cubic metre. However, this seems to be much less
used than the litre (1000 litres = 1 cubic metre).To change any of these other
units of volume into their equivalent values in litres use the operation and
conversion factor given. Those marked with # are exact. Other values are given
to an appropriate degree of accuracy.
The litre. There can be some ambiguity about the size of the litre. In 1901 it
was defined by reference to a kilogram of pure water under certain particular
conditions. (This was similar to the way the old UK gallon was set.) In 1964 it
was re-defined as a common usage term for a cubic decimetre. They differ very
slightly and for really accurate work, to avoid any possible confusion, it is
recommended that the litre is not used . It is used here as being a cubic
decimetre.

Line density

Line density is a measure of mass per unit length. The S I compatible unit of
line density is kilograms/metre. A major use of line density is in the textile
industry to indicate the coarseness of a yarn or fibre. For that purpose the SI
unit is rather large so the preferred unit there is the tex. (1 tex = 1
gram/kilometre) To change any of these other units of line density into their
equivalent values in kilograms/metre use the operation and conversion factor
given. Those marked with # are exact. Other values are given to an appropriate

Density

Density is the shortened term generally used in place of the more accurate
description volumetric density.It is a measure of mass per unit volume. The S I
compatible unit of density is kilograms/cubic metre. However, this a rather
large unit for most purposes (iron is over 7000, wood is about 600 and even
cork is over 200). A much more useful size of unit is kilograms/litre (for
which the previous values then become 7, 0.6 and 0.2 respectively). This unit
also has the great advantage of being numerically unchanged for grams/cubic
centimetre and tonnes/cubic metre (or megagrams/cubic metre). To change any of
these other units of density into their equivalent values in kilograms/litre
use the operation and conversion factor given. Those marked with # are exact.
Other values are given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.

Energy or work

There is a lot of room for confusion in some of the units used here. The
calorie can take 5 different values and, while these do not vary by very much,
for accurate work it is necessary to specify which calorie is being used.
The 5 calories are known as the International Table calorie - cal(IT); the
thermochemical calorie - cal(th); the mean calorie - cal(mean); the 15 degree C
calorie - cal(15C); and the 20 degree C calorie - cal(20C).
As a further complication, in working with food and expressing nutritional
values, the unit of a Calorie (capital C) is often used to represent 1000
calories, and again it is necessary to specify which calorie is being used for
that.
The British thermal unit (Btu) can also take different values and they are
named in a similar way to the calorie, that is Btu (IT), (th), etc. Also note
that the therm is 100 000 Btu so its exact size depends on which Btu is being
used.

The S I unit of energy or work is the joule. To change any of these other units
of energy or work into their equivalent values in joules use the operation and
conversion factor given. Those marked with # are exact. Other values are given
to an appropriate degree of accuracy.

Fuel Consumption

Fuel consumption of any means of transport (car, aeroplane, ship etc.) that
uses fuel is a measure giving the relationship between the distance travelled
for an amount of fuel used. The most common example is the car where it is
usually expressed (in English-speaking countries) in miles per gallon.
It could also be expressed in gallons per mile. However, for a car the latter
method gives a rather small figure: 35 miles per gallon is about 0.0286 gallons
per mile. In that case it would be better to give a figure for 100 miles, so it
would be 2.86 gallons per 100 miles. That is the metric way of expressing fuel
consumption - as litres per 100 kilometres.
From regular enquiries it appears that in real life people are using all sorts
of ways of expressing their fuel consumption, so this section (unlike all the
others) tries to cover as many ways as possible. All the values are given to an
accuracy of 4 significant figures.

To change                       into
        miles per gallon (UK)           miles per gallon (US) multiply by 0.833
        miles per gallon (UK)           miles per litre multiply by 0.22
        miles per litre                 miles per gallon (UK) multiply by 4.456
        miles per gallon (UK)           kilometres per litre multiply by 0.354

        miles per gallon (US)           miles per gallon (UK) multiply by 1.2
        miles per gallon (US)           miles per litre multiply by 0.2642
        miles per litre                 miles per gallon (US) multiply by 3.785
        miles per gallon (US)           kilometres per litre multiply by 0.4251

        X miles per gallon               gallons per 100 miles: divide 100 by X
                                        (both gallons must of the same type)

        X miles per gallon (UK)          litres per 100 km: divide 282.5 by X
        X miles per gallon (US)          litres per 100 km: divide 235.2 by X
        X km per litre                   litres per 100 km: divide 100  by X
        X miles per litre                litres per 100 km: divide 62.14  by X

Power

Since power is a measure of the rate at which work is done, the underlying
units are those of work or energy, and that section should be looked at for
explanations concerning the calorie and Btu. In this section the (IT) values
have been used.
In this section it is the horsepower which provides confusion. Just like the
calorie, it can take 5 different values, and these are identified as necessary
by the addition of (boiler), (electric), (metric), (UK) and (water). Unlike the
calorie (whose 5 values are reasonably close to each other), the horsepower has
4 which are close and 1 (boiler) which is considerably different - it is about
13 times bigger than the others - but it seems to be very little used.

The S I unit of power is the watt. To change any of these other units of energy
or work into their equivalent values in watts use the operation and conversion
factor given. Those marked with # are exact. Other values are given to an
appropriate degree of accuracy.

Spread Rate (by mass)

The spread rate of a substance is a measure of how much of it there is covering
a unit area. The 'how much' can be measured by volume or by mass. The S I
compatible unit of spread rate by mass is kilograms/square metre. It is also a
measure of area density (mass/unit area) and is similar to - but not the same
as - pressure, which is force/unit area. For the rainfall conversions a density
of 1 kg/litre has been assumed. To change any of these other units of spread
rate into their equivalent values in kilograms/square metre use the operation
and conversion factor given. Those marked with # are exact. Other values are
given to an appropriate degree of accuracy. The conversion for rainfall assumes
a density of 1 kg/litre which is accurate enough for all practical purposes.

Spread Rate (by volume)

The spread rate of a substance is a measure of how much of it there is covering
a unit area. The 'how much' can be measured by volume or by mass. The S I
compatible unit of spread rate by volume is cubic metres/square metre. However,
this is a rather large unit for most purposes and so litres/square metre is
often preferred. To change any of these other units of spread rate into their
equivalent values in litres/square metre use the operation and conversion
factor given. Those marked with # are exact. Other values are given to an
appropriate degree of accuracy.
