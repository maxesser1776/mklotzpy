The relative humidity can be found by using a psychrometer.  The conventional
style uses two identical thermometers.  One of these has the bulb cooled with
a wick soaked in water - one of the older 'tubular' shoelaces works well as a
wick.  Arrange a gentle flow of air over the wick.  Naturally, the 'wet bulb'
thermometer will read a lower temperature than the 'dry bulb' thermometer due
to the cooling afforded by the evaporation of water from the wick.

From the temperature difference between the two thermometers, it's possible to
compute the relative humidity and the dew point temperature.  That's what this
program does.
