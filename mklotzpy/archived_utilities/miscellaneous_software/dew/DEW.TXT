Rust is the bane of the HSM.  Condensation will form on metal tools if the tool
temperature falls below the dew point temperature.  One way to prevent this is
to warm the tools in some way so their temperature remains above the dew point
temperature.

Of course, to do this one needs to be able to calculate the dew point
temperature.  It depends on the ambient temperature and the relative humidity
in the air.  Enter values for these two parameters into the program and it will
print out the dew point temperature.

The region of validity for the program is:

Ambient temperatures between 0 degC (32 degF) and 60 degC (140 degF)

Relative humidity between 1 and 100 percent
