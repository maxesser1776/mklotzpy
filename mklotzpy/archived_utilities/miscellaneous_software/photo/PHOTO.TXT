	Frequently one of my (or somebody else's) programs writes a nice
solution to a problem on the (text) screen.  You'd like to save this screen and
incorporate it into something you're writing via your favorite editor or do
some other problem with the program and assemble all the solutions into a
single file for printing, transmitting, or incorporating.

	These are cases where printing the text screen doesn't accomplish what
you need.  I wrote PHOTO to deal with such situations.

	Every time you type PHOTO at the DOS prompt, the program appends what
is currently on the text screen to the file C:\PHOTO.  If C:\PHOTO doesn't
exist, it will be created automatically.  If it does exist and already
contains some screen copies, the current screen contents will be appended to
whatever is already there.

	So, for example, you can sit there knocking out mixtures (with MIXTURE
- see MIXTURE.ZIP) and after each solution appears on the screen, type PHOTO
(make sure PHOTO is in the path) and compile all these solutions into
one file (C:\PHOTO).  When done, attach C:\PHOTO to the email you're sending
to your friend who needs the data or print it for your own use.  After you've
played with PHOTO for a while, you'll probably think of other creative ways to
use it.  If you've downloaded L.COM (see L.ZIP), you can use it to view what
is currently contained in C:\PHOTO or, more clumsily, type C:\PHOTO to the
screen via MORE.

	PHOTO is written in assembly language so I won't guarantee that it
will work on everybody's system.  It doesn't do anything dangerous so, the
worst damage it can cause if it doesn't work is to create a useless file in
your root directory - no worse than running windows, which seems to consist
mainly of self-created useless files.

	PHOTO will NOT work with graphic screens.
