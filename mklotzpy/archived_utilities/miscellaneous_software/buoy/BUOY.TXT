The upward buoyant force on a buoy is equal to the weight of the liquid
displaced when the buoy is immersed.  In turn, this weight is equal to the
volume of the buoy below the liquid surface multiplied by the density of the
liquid in which it is immersed.

The buoy sinks into the liquid to such a point that the upward buoyant force is
just equal to the weight of the buoy plus any load that the buoy supports.

Given the pertinent information mentioned above (liquid density, buoy geometry
and buoy weight plus load), the program calculates how far the buoy will sink
into the liquid.
