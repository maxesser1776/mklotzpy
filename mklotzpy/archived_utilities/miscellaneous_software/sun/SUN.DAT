Data for SUN.EXE

Latitude is measured positive north of the equator, negative south of the
equator - permissible range is -90 <= latitude <= 90 deg.

Longitude is measured positive WESTWARD from Greenwich, negative eastwards
 - permissible range is -180 <= longitude <= 180 deg.

One way to get fairly accurate values for lat and lon is to find someone who
has a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and ask him to take a reading. 
Your local airport may also be able to supply accurate values.

UT (Universal Time) offsets are measured negative westward from Greenwich.  In
the absence of any daylight saving adjustments, Los Angeles time = Universal
time - 8 hours (i.e., it's 8 hours earlier in LA than it is in London).  The
correct values for the conus time zones are shown below.

	Eastern time zone	-5,-4
	Central time zone	-6,-5
	Mountain time zone	-7,-6
	Pacific time zone	-8,-7

Note that UT is not ALWAYS the same as the time in London. UT NEVER 'goes on
daylight savings'.  The British DO employ daylight savings (I think it's
called something like 'British Summer Time').  If you have access to a
short-wave receiver capable of receiving WWV or WWVH (the USNBS time broadcast
stations), you can determine UT from their transmissions.  Alternatively, with
a web browser, go to:

        http://www.hilink.com.au/times/

and you can determine UT as well as local time in many locations around the
world.

If daylight savings is not used in your area (e.g., Hawaii), enter the same
value as used for the standard time offset.  Some areas of the world have half
hour offsets - enter as a decimal fraction, e.g., -9.5 hr.

Four data items must be entered in the order shown below.

Anything entered before the next line will be ignored by the program.
