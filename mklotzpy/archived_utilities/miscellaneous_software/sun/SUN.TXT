The program is based on information found in:

		Almanac for Computers for the year 1978

published by the

		Nautical Almanac Office
		United States Naval Observatory
		Washington, DC 20390

In this publication, two types of series expansions are presented.  A short
term Chebyshev series valid only for 1978 is useless for long term
computation.  However, a much more complex trigonometric series is described
which is valid for a 300 year span 1800-2100.  It is this latter series that
is implemented in the program.  The Almanac lists the following accuracies for
computed quantities:

	sun position		1E-4 AU
	sun velocity		1E-5 AU/day
	right ascension		0.1 minute
	declination		1 arc minute
	distance		5E-5 AU
